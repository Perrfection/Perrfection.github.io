									<p> My name is Perrfection Michelle Kendra Peterkin but I often go by Ken or Kendra. I am a lover 
										of linguistics and I have a strong belief in the efforts to supply everyday curious minds 
										with the resources they need to pursue education. I am a first generation American, born to
										a mother who came to America in her early teens from a small island in the Caribbean 
										called St. Lucia. Her culture and moral compass taught me the importance of education and
										determination in every aspect of life. Beginning with math, I developed a fondness for 
										applied and natural sciences at a young age, which eventually led me to my extensive 
										education in computer science. What started as Scratch in middle school developed into
										building robots and video games in high school and a summer internship with girls who 
										code, all of which encouraged me to gain my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. In 
										contrast to my drive towards technological fields, I have also always gravitated toward
										areas of multicultural experience and strongly valued the pursuit and access to all areas 
										of study. I pursued a minor in Chinese Studies, a challenging linguistic and cultural 
										experience I would not trade for anything. My passions truly collided in college when 
										I stopped complaining about my discontent with misinformation and lack of access to 
										information concerning compressive sexuality education (CSE) in the US. Instead, 
										I decided to place my energy into building an app to solve the problem, which later 
										became my senior thesis. This is only a short summery of the paths I have crossed and 
										the lives I have lived, but I hope to experience and share much more as time ensues.</p>
